#Sets are used to store unique items in a single variable. It's written with curly brackets.

# If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error but discard() wont.

# The  | operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the  union() method.

# The update() changes the original set, and does not return a new set.

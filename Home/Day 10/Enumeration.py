#Enumeration refers to the action of listing items or values one by one, often accompanied by assigning a unique identifier or index to each item in the list. It's commonly used in programming to iterate over a collection of items while keeping track of their position or index.

my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

for index, fruit in enumerate(my_list):
    print(index, fruit)
